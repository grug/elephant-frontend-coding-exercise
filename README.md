# Elephant coding exercise

Hi there, this our coding exercise we're going to do today.

**It's not expected that we'll get through everything - we just want to use this exercise to start a conversation :)**

## The task

At Weather-Corp, we're excited about providing users with the latest and greatest London weather information through our amazing web application. The problem is that our only engineer working on the site has left and we now need you to help us complete it.

We need our weather application to:

- Display weather information for today: date, city name, current temperature, description of current conditions, wind speed, wind direction, UV, humidity

Fortunately, the engineer who previously worked on the application had already written the code to retrieve the weather data for you from the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/). You can find that code [here](./src/api.ts).

You can see a [rough design](./Design.png) for some inspiration for how things work.
